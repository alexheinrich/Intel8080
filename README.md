# Intel 8080 Disassembler and Emulator

Work in progress for a disassembler and emulator of the Intel 8080 8-bit microprocessor. Can run early 8-bit games such as Space invaders!

## How to build

To build the disassembler and emulator, run:
```
make
```

This will result in a program called 'disassembler8080', which can then be run in the command line with the path to the file to disassembled as arguments:

```
./disassembler8080 <filename>
```
